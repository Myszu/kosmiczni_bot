# Kosmiczni Bot

A bot for web browser game Kosmiczni.

It is designed to pilot your character and help with the most repeated tasks in the game.
Patterns are added to file and assigned to the map.

Whole project is in very early state. I started it to learn Python and Selenium. Since then my skills advance drastically, yet I couldn't find the time to develop it further. Hopefully creating repository will push mi a little into consistency.

I have a lot of ideas for improvements and new functions, so there is potential, now I have to balance my time more efficiently.
