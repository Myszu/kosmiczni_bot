# Kosmiczni Bot

## Description

A bot for web browser game [Kosmiczni](https://kosmiczni.pl/). It is designed to pilot your character and help with the most repetitive task in game - crousing around the map and encountering mobs. Patterns are assigned to maps and are written in file, hence are easy to modify by user. In fact - project includes seperate tool for captchuring pressed keys while traveling through map and are then saved to separatee file to use.

Whole project is in very early state. I started it to learn Python and Selenium. Since then my skills advance drastically, yet I couldn't find the time to develop it further. Hopefully creating repository will push mi a little into consistency.

I have a lot of ideas for improvements and new functions, so there is potential, now I have to balance my time more efficiently.

## Modules 

- PyQt for rendering user interface.
- Selenium for browser actions automation.
- keyboard for keygen, which helps designing path for exping.

other modules have just a supporting purpose.
